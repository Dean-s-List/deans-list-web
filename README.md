**Dean’s List  - serviceDAO website Spec**

**Overview:** The website was first started as part a Solana Foundation Grant. On top of this foundation we are building a dedicated landing page/portal for citizens and clients to join and work with the Dean’s List Network State. 


**The website is designed to help:**
- Facilitate new citizens to join our network state
- Facilitate clients to engage with our network state
- Showcase what we do in our network state


**Our Services:**

We have 3 service verticals that are a unique amalgamation of our collective skill set & guide our product offerings with an aim to help improve the wider ecosystem. These are: 

- Feedback 
- Marketing
- DAO Consulting

**Access Requirements For Clients**

Till the time our dashboard goes live, clients may utilize our Web3 e-commerce store powered by Coinable to make a purchase & access our services. On a successful purchase, you will be contacted by One Of Us as regards to the next steps. 

If there are any reasons that preclude us from accepting your business, then the payment will be refunded to the payment address that sent the tokens. No refunds will be given once a project has been started and work has begun.

For the future, we are working towards having a self hosted platform as part of the access protocol to our dashboard that will enable customers to purchase one of our services through our website directly.

**Access Requirements For Citizens**

At the moment, The Dean's List Network State operates primarily through our Discord server. You may obtain citizenship & gain access to the server by:

- Purchasing a Business Visa: https://coinablepay.com/@deanslist 
- Purchasing one of our NFTs on the secondary market: https://www.tensor.trade/trade/deanslist

For the future, we are working towards adding in automated and shift workflows to our dashboard utilizing the aforesaid methods of verification. We are also exploring the possibility of non-citizens participating in our GDP as well and other opportunities to improve our state in meaningful ways.
