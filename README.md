# deans-list-web

**Dean’s List  - serviceDAO website Spec**

**Overview:** As part of our Solana Foundation Grant, we are building a dedicated landing page/portal for members and clients to join and work with Dean’s List 

**The goal of creating this is to **
- Make it easier for a new member to join the serviceDAO
- Make it easier for a client to engage the serviceDAO 
- Showcase what we do in this serviceDAO

**These are additional goals to consider for this first iteration or for a future roadmap of the portal**
- Move the feedback/membership experience onto the platform (this would also include the tracking ideas brought up by Hanko)
- Allow other serviceDAOs to spin up their own dedicated portal
- Allow other serviceDAOs to create their own token
- Power the content management and forms with a web3 solution
- Integration with Realms for client processes and distribution
- Merch shop for DAOs
- Auction process for purchasing feedback services 

**Minimum Requirements for the Portal**

For Clients:

Acquire 50 DEAN  – best version is to swap from any token to DEAN, but enabling the basic swap is good for this phase. We should include a link/process to acquire GRAPE if the swap only supports the basic swap and the purchase could automatically calculate how much GRAPE is needed

Bounty creation– this could be part of the acquire process. The 50 DEAN needs to be deposited into the Treasury account on Realms. Ideally, this deposit also comes with some information similar to the existing bounty process we use on Strata (we could also use the Strata bounty code, if that is easier, but there is the issue that the deposit goes to the mint wallet and not Realms).
 
Information to request:
- Name of Project
- Contact details for bounty submitter
- Logo of the project
- Description of the project and feedback priorities

For Members:

Acquire 1 DEAN  - same as above

Signup and Discord link – ideally this is a web3 powered form (token gated by DEAN), but we could use the same process we use for bounty creation or a google form. The goal here is to get some onboarding data about the member. 

** The below features are for future roadmap or can be part of the first phase if they are not difficult/time consuming **

Admin Panel:

Admin assignment – the CMS for the platform should be assigned to a specific wallet address. 

Token management for clients/members – this would set the token required to get service/join the DAO. Select mint, select amount for client/member, and select treasury destination for the bounties

Token creation – this would let new DAOs create their own Strata tokens. Set the name, the bonding curve, the logo, the destination of royalties/bounties, and the royalty amount.
